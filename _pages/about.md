<!-- ## About Me ([CV](/files/CV/cv.pdf)) -->
I'm Xiangjun Tang ([CV](/files/CV/cv.pdf)), a post-doctoral fellow at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/research/generative-ai) currently working with Professor [Peter Wonka]("https://peterwonka.net/"). In 2024, I completed my PhD in Computer Technology at the [State Key Lab of CAD&CG of Zhejiang University](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn), under the guidance of Professor [Xiaogang Jin]("http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/jin"). Prior to that, I earned my bachelor's degree in Digital Media from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in 2019. I'm excited to continue my research and contribute to the field of computer graphics at KAUST.
